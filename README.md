## 🔒 What is Layer8?

**Layer8** is a secure AI middleware built for industrial and enterprise users who rely on AI platforms but can't risk exposing sensitive data.

We sit between your AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, open-source models) and your input — encrypting everything in real time using **confidential computing** (Intel SGX, AMD SEV, AWS Nitro Enclaves).

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Bring Your Own LLM (BYO-LLM)** — Works with any AI model you prefer.
- 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption** — Your data stays encrypted even during inference.
- ☁️ **Runs in Secure Enclaves** — No data is stored on disk. Ever.
- 🧩 **Easy Integration** — Drop-in privacy layer with minimal code changes.
